          <p>
            I am Sam. Sam I am.
            Do you like to Program and Develop?
            Would you like it here? Or there?
            I would not like them here or there, I would not like to anywhere.
            Would you could you from a bus?
            Look a train, a train, would you could you from a train? Or in the rain?
            You may like it, you will see! Try and code for me.
            Say I do like to program and develop.
            I WOULD program here or there. I would program in a chair. I would program from home or even on the phone.
            I would program from a bus, and on a train or even in the rain!
            Say I DO LIKE to program and develop.  I WOULD LIKE IT here or there, I could do this ANYWHERE!
            I am Sam. Sam I am.
            I like to Program and Develop, yes I can.
            <br>
            Born on the US Virgin Islands and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area.
            Experienced in customer service after spending over 25 years helping run the family business. 
            Recognized by the community as the friendly neighborhood shop owner. While still loved by the 
            community, he has been cheered on as he follows his dreams of getting into the tech world. While
             it was once a hobby, it has now become his reality.
            His prior hobbies included Photography, and Digital Media where he received his degree in Photography
            at Chabot College. He loves all things Star Wars, enjoys comedy shows, music, dogs, and hiking with 
            his family. You are likely to catch him with a cup of coffee in his hand and his laptop in the other.
            He goes above and beyond to help those in need that cross his path. Though large in stature when you
            meet him may have you thinking he is a big tough guy when actually he is warm-hearted and speaks with
            purpose, precision and power.
